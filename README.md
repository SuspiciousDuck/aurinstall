# aurinstall
This is a program to automate installing things on an Arch system. I was frustrated having to manually install things that were not on pacman when installing things like ffmpeg-full. With this, it is completely automated! There are likely plenty bugs with this, as it's just a small side project and I have only tested this on my machine.

# Usage
To install, just download the zip folder and unzip it with a program of your choice. <br>
Next, run the `main.py` file in the folder. <br>
You will be given a choice if you are ready to install a package <br>
If you continued, you will have to type the package name or its package site on `archlinux.org`. <br>
If all goes well, hopefully it will install it without any errors!
